        <h2>Uncertain origin</h2>
        <p>
          The origin of such a peculiar nickname is not certain and there are
          several versions about its history. Besides knowing it as the "White
          City", the city has another variation: "The White Merida"; which if
          you ever visit, is going to be very common for you to hear in locals
          and tourists.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first version says that it was named after the color white that
          predominates in the buildings erected by the Spanish over the ruins of
          Mayan temples.

        <h2>From architecture to music</h2>
        <p>
          Other of the many versions say that Mérida has the name of "White
          City" because many of its constructions used limestone typical of the
          region, which make it stand out even more with the rays of the sun,
          but also tell what the nickname is attributed to the cleanliness of
          its streets and the color of the traditional clothing of its
          inhabitants like the guayaberas in men and hipiles in women.
        </p>
        One of the last versions is that the ex president Adolfo Ruiz Cortines
        came with Pepe Guizar, famous singer, to visit the city. Inspired by the
        beautiful landscape, he wrote the homonymous song. Finally, I encourage
        you to visit and discover all the places Merida has to offer by giving
